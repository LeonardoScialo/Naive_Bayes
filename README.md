# Naive Bayes From Scratch
* Naive Bayes classifier model developed in python from scratch on the iris dataset - the algorithm itself is build solely with numpy and built-in Python modules;
* Developed in vector notation utilising numpy for a more efficient computational analysis;
* The dataset used is solely numeric, and therefore calculates the normal distribution for each entry for each feature;
* Outputs a confusion matrix and a performance table;
* Outputs the total accuracy.

## Code and Resources Used
**Python Version:** 3.8

**Packages:** numpy, pandas, scikit-learn (for splitting the data)
